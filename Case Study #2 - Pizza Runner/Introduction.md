# Case Study Questions
## This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

### Pizza Metrics
### Runner and Customer Experience
### Ingredient Optimisation
### Pricing and Ratings
### Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.
Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!
